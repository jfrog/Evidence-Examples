# **Jira Ticket Tracking Evidence Example**

This repository provides a working example of a GitHub Actions workflow that automates Jira ticket tracking and validation. It extracts Jira ticket IDs from git commit messages, validates their existence and workflow transitions, and attaches the resulting ticket summary as signed, verifiable evidence to the package in **JFrog Artifactory**.

This workflow is an essential pattern for DevSecOps and project management, creating a traceable, compliant, and auditable software development process that links code changes to Jira tickets.

## **Key Features**

* **Automated Jira ID Extraction**: Extracts Jira ticket IDs from git commit messages using configurable regex patterns.
* **Ticket Validation**: Validates that extracted Jira tickets exist and retrieves their current status and metadata.
* **Workflow Transition Tracking**: Captures the complete workflow history and transitions for each ticket.
* **Evidence Generation**: Creates a jira-results.json predicate file with comprehensive ticket information.
* **Optional Markdown Report**: Integrated markdown generation for human-readable summaries from the Jira JSON results.
* **Signed Evidence Attachment**: Attaches the ticket tracking results to the corresponding package version in Artifactory using `jf evd create`, cryptographically signing it for integrity.
* **Consolidated Tool**: All functionality is now consolidated into a single Go application for simplicity and maintainability.

## **Workflow Overview**

The following diagram illustrates the sequence of operations performed by the GitHub Actions workflow.

## **Architecture**

### **Components**

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/jira-evidence-example.yml`)
   - Orchestrates the complete CI/CD process
   - Manages environment variables and secrets
   - Triggers JIRA evidence gathering

2. **JIRA Helper Application** (`helper/main.go`)
   - Consolidated Go application for all JIRA operations
   - Extracts JIRA IDs from git commits
   - Fetches comprehensive ticket details from JIRA API
   - Generates structured JSON output

3. **Markdown Generation** (integrated into `helper/main.go`)
   - Optional markdown report generation
   - Converts JSON data to formatted Markdown tables
   - Controlled by `ATTACH_OPTIONAL_CUSTOM_MARKDOWN_TO_EVIDENCE` environment variable

4. **Docker Application** (`Dockerfile`, `app/`)
   - Sample application for demonstration
   - Gets packaged and pushed to Artifactory

## **Prerequisites**

Before running this workflow, you must have:

* JFrog CLI 2.65.0 or above (installed automatically in the workflow)
* An Artifactory repository (e.g., jira-evidence-repo)
* A private key and a corresponding key alias configured in your JFrog Platform for signing evidence
* Access to a Jira instance with API credentials
* Go 1.21 or later (for building the helper application)

## **Configuration**

### **GitHub Secrets**

Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and create the following secrets:

| Secret Name | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| ARTIFACTORY_ACCESS_TOKEN | A valid JFrog Access Token with permissions to read, write, and annotate in your target repository. |
| PRIVATE_KEY | The private key used to sign the evidence. This key corresponds to the alias configured in JFrog Platform. |
| JF_USER | The username for Artifactory Docker registry authentication. |
| JIRA_USERNAME | The username of the Jira user account used for API authentication. |
| JIRA_API_TOKEN | The API token for the Jira user account. Generate this from your Jira account settings. |

### **GitHub Variables**

Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and create the following variables:

| Variable Name | Description | Example Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| JF_URL | The base URL of your JFrog Platform instance. | https://mycompany.jfrog.io |
| JIRA_URL | The base URL of your Jira instance. | https://mycompany.atlassian.net |
| JIRA_PROJECT_KEY | The project key for Jira tickets to validate. | EV |
| JIRA_ID_REGEX | Regex pattern to extract Jira IDs from commit messages. | (EV-\d+) |
| EVIDENCE_KEY_ALIAS | The alias for the public key in JFrog Platform used to verify the evidence signature. | my-signing-key-alias |

### **Workflow Environment Variables**

You can customize the workflow's behavior by modifying the env block in the `.github/workflows/jira-evidence-example.yml` file:

| Variable Name | Description | Default Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| REPO_NAME | The name of the target Docker repository in Artifactory. | docker-jira-repo-local |
| IMAGE_NAME | The name of the Docker image to be built and pushed. | docker-jira-image |
| BUILD_NAME | The name assigned to the build information in Artifactory. | jira-docker-build |
| ATTACH_OPTIONAL_CUSTOM_MARKDOWN_TO_EVIDENCE | Set to true to generate and attach a Markdown report alongside the JSON evidence. Set to false to skip this step. | true |

## **Usage**

### **Running the Workflow**

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your forked repository.
2. In the left sidebar, click on the **Jira evidence integration example** workflow.
3. Click the **Run workflow** dropdown button. You can leave the default branch selected.
4. Click the green **Run workflow** button.

### **Workflow Inputs**

- **start_commit**: Starting commit hash (excluded from evidence filter) - **Required**
- **fetch_depth**: Number of previous commits to fetch (default is 10) - **Optional**

## **Output Schema**

The workflow generates a structured JSON file (`transformed_jira_data.json`) with the following schema:

```json
{
  "ticketRequested": ["EV-123", "EV-456"],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "key": "EV-123",
      "status": "In Progress",
      "description": "Task description",
      "type": "Task",
      "project": "EV",
      "created": "2020-01-01T12:11:56.063+0530",
      "updated": "2020-01-01T12:12:01.876+0530",
      "assignee": "John Doe",
      "reporter": "Jane Smith",
      "priority": "Medium",
      "transitions": [
        {
          "from_status": "To Do",
          "to_status": "In Progress",
          "author": "John Doe",
          "author_user_name": "john.doe@company.com",
          "transition_time": "2020-07-28T16:39:54.620+0530"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Jira ID Extraction Patterns**

The workflow supports configurable regex patterns for extracting Jira IDs from commit messages. Common patterns include:

* **Simple Project Key**: `(EV-\d+)` - Matches tickets like EV-123, EV-456
* **Multiple Projects**: `((EV|PROJ|BUG)-\d+)` - Matches tickets from multiple projects
* **Case Insensitive**: `(?i)(ev-\d+)` - Matches case variations like ev-123, EV-123

## **Error Handling**

The workflow includes comprehensive error handling:

* **Invalid Jira IDs**: Tickets that don't match the configured regex pattern are logged and skipped
* **Non-existent Tickets**: Tickets that don't exist in Jira are marked as "Error" in the results
* **API Failures**: Network or authentication issues are logged with appropriate error messages
* **Empty Results**: If no valid Jira IDs are found, the workflow continues with an empty result set
